# IDS_Ontology

The main aim of this project was to understand if Ontology based Intrusion detection system performs better than using Machine Learning Techniques for SlowDOS attacks.

The answer in short is it depends how you construct the IDS.
We did the following as a part of the project.
1) Used Machine Learning Techniques

Using feature selection algorithms to pick important features for slow DoS attacks.

Generating multi label classifiers to detect four classes of slow dos attack

Signature for slowloris attack

2) Used Ontology based Techniques

Based on the dataset available to us, observed the patterns and the anomilies we selected the features.

Based on the features, we constructed an Ontology using a tool called Protege.

The interesting aspect about the Ontology based IDS was that it gave us 100 percent accuracy. 

Hence it depends on how you construct the ontology based on the features.
